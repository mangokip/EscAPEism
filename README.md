Hey, welcome to my repository for my first game in Unreal Engine 5, dubbed EscAPEism. Don't expect something perfect - this project is mostly me messing around with the engine to make something small in an aesthetic I enjoy using a game genre I enjoy. There may be bugs, imperfections, and various other things that aren't amazing just yet. I've had a lot of fun creating this and I really hope you enjoy this little game I've been working on, as simple as it looks. Thanks for checking this out!

As stated in my Wiki, all assets (including models, music, SFX, design, animations, art, etc. EVERYTHING! was produced by yours truly!) -- with the exception of some pre-existing free things such as soundfonts or text fonts, utilized in music or SFX.
